            <p class="mintext" style="left: 13px;" >Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Wednesday employees should begin returning to offices in early September for at least three days a week. The iPhone maker is pushing staff to return on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at a minimum, with remote work still an option for Wednesdays and Fridays, Cook said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
                <br><br>
                    “We are setting consistent days in the office to help us optimize our time for in-person collaboration,” he wrote. Some teams will have to be in four or five days a week.
                <br><br> In pushing for staff to return, Cook cited the availability of vaccinations and declining coronavirus infection rates.Some employees of the Cupertino, California-based technology.

He previously told staff they might return as early as June, but the company pushed that back to September a few weeks ago.
